This folder contains all the required data for analysis 
The contents of thsi folder are:
1) 3D matrix of all modifications
2)steady state histone PTM's
3)Transcriptions rates
4)files created during analysis


final_matrix.rda → Histone modification signals (matrix).

steady_state_headers.rda → Names of 26 histone modifications.

genelist.rda → List of yeast gene identifiers.

yeast_genes_trans_rates.csv → Transcription rates for yeast genes.

Transrate.csv → Reference dataset for transcription rates with gene mapping.

my_list.csv & output.csv → Mapping files for resolving missing genes.
